#### HW4:<br>
* SPI communication with an MCP4902 DAC chip
* Code tells the DAC to output a 10Hz sine wave and 5Hz triangle wave

#### HW5:<br>
* I2C communication with an MCP23008 chip
* Code tells the chip to turn off a yellow LED when a button hooked up to GP7 is pressed

#### HW6:<br>
* TFT LCD display using SPI communication
* Code prints the image of a hedgehog and "Hello World!" to the screen, draws a progress bar which fills as a counter increases from 0-100, and outputs a live reading of the frames per second rate

#### HW7:<br>
* LCD progress bar display of accelerometer xy readings from an LSM6DS33 chip

#### HW8:<br>
* Replica of HW7 using Harmony

#### HW12:<br>
